# CDCPS
The cdcps module provides several methods for illustrating the topics covered in the lecture "Control of Distributed Cyber-Physical Systems". The following topics will be addressed: 
- solving LTI systems in the time domain 
- representation of LTI systems in the frequency domain  
- representation and analysis of graphs
- analysis and simulation of multi-agent systems  (e.g. consensus and synchronization problems)  

### Additional Packages
